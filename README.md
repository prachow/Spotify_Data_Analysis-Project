#Spotify Data Analysis Project

 This project involves analyzing Spotify data to gain insights into albums, artists, and tracks. The datasets are stored in AWS S3, transformed and joined using AWS Glue, queried with Athena, and visualized in AWS QuickSight. The goal is to efficiently process, analyze, and present the data using AWS cloud services.

Technologies Used:

AWS S3: Used for storing raw datasets (albums, artists, tracks).

AWS Glue: Transforms and joins the data from different sources to create a unified dataset for analysis.

AWS Athena: Queries the transformed data stored in S3 using SQL-like syntax for fast and cost-efficient querying.

AWS QuickSight: Provides data visualizations and business intelligence insights into the Spotify data.

Project Flow:

Data Storage: The Spotify datasets (albums, artists, tracks) are uploaded to Amazon S3.

Data Transformation: AWS Glue is used to clean, transform, and join the datasets into a cohesive format.

Data Querying: AWS Athena is employed to run queries on the transformed data stored in S3.

Data Visualization: The results of the queries are visualized using AWS QuickSight, providing easy-to-understand insights about the Spotify data.
